Welcome to The Alfa Jango Handbook to Awesomeness.

> Our little book of company policies and workflows, and tips and advise
> for our startups and clients.

We are passionate about
open-source software and development to our core. This handbook is an
experiment in open-sourcing our business as well. Through the years,
we've developed some workflows, processes, and custom software that have
improved the process of developing and releasing software for
startups. This handbook aims to document and release our
findings, including with the source code for our internal systems.

We hope you find this resource useful on your journey through the
world of startup development with Alfa Jango.
