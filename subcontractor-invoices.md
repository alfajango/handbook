1. <label class="checkbox"><input type="checkbox"> Make sure you have
   the PDF ready to be entered into the Subcontractor Dashboard. If the
   contractor sent a link e.g. via Freshbooks, you can click the "PDF"
   in Freshbooks to download the invoice PDF.</label>

   Dashboard, go to the "Contractor Invoices" tab and click the "Add
   Contractor Invoce" button at the top.</label>

   from the invoice into the Subcontractor Dashboard.</label>

  1. The "Person" is the person who logged the time from the invoice
     into Cashboard.
  2. The "Project ids" are all of the projects which have billable time
     included in the invoice. You can hold Cmd (on Macs) or Ctrl (on
     Windows) to select multiple projects. If you're not sure whether a
     particular project was included in the invoice, go ahead and select it.
     The projects selected here determine which time entries show up on the
     next page to match to the invoice, so you can always uncheck time
     entries on the next page that aren't included in the invoice.
  3. The "Issue date" is the date the invoice was sent to us.
  4. The "Due date" is the date payment is due to the subcontractor for
     the invoice amount. This may vary from subcontractor to
     subcontractor, as depending on our terms, payment may be due 15 days
     from the "Issue date" (net-15 terms), 30 days (net-30), or some other
     date. Oftentimes, the due date or terms can be found on the
     invoice. Freshbooks, for example, usually puts the terms at the bottom
     of the invoice under the total.

  5. The "Work start date" and "Work end date" fields are the dates
     within which the work was performed and logged in Cashboard.
     Typically, you can scan the time entries in the subcontractor invoice
     for the earliest and latest time entry dates to enter here. If you're
     not sure, you can guess as well; the next screen will allow you to
     change them if necessary.
  6. The "Invoice Number" is the subcontractor's own invoice number on
     the invoice. This will allow us to easily reference if we ever need
     to verify anything with the subcontractor.
  7. The "Invoice Total" is the total amount from the invoice (not
     necessarily the amount due, which could be different if we had an
     outstanding credit with the subcontractor that has been applied to the
     invoice already).
  8. The "Attachment" field is where you can now browse to the PDF of
     the invoice on your computer to upload to the Subcontractor
     Dashboard.
  9. Click "Create Invoice".
4. <label class="checkbox"><input type="checkbox"> Match up the time
   entries from Cashboard so that the Total from the Cashboard time
   entries matches the Total from the invoice.</label>
  ![Subcontractor Invoice Time Entries](/assets/images/subcontractor-invoice-time-entries.png)
  1. Click the "Select All" link on the left above the time entries.
  2. If the Totals match, indicated by a green "0" (zero), click the
     "Save" button.
  3. If the Totals do not match, and the time entries from Cashboard are
     greater than the subcontractor invoice total, unselect time entries
     until the totals match. You may need to look at the PDF invoice and
     compare the dates, hours, and notes from each time entry to determine
     which entries from Cashboard are not included in the subcontractor
     invoice.
  4. If the Totals do not match, and the time entries from Cashboard are
     less than the subcontractor invoice total, try setting the "Work
     Start Date" at the top to an earlier date to find more time entries from
     Cashboard which may have their entered date off from the date listed in
     the subcontractor invoice. Likewise, try setting the "Work End Date" to
     a later date.
  5. Once the Total match, click "Save".
  6. If the Totals cannot be made to match, you may leave this screen
     and move onto the next invoice to come back to this one later.
5. <label class="checkbox"><input type="checkbox"> You should now see
   the invoice created in the list of subcontractor invoices, either
   highlighted green if matched, or unhighlighted if unmatched.</label>
